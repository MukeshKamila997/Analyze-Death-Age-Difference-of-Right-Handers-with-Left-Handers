# Analyze-Death-Age-Difference-of-Right-Handers-with-Left-Handers
In this project, we will explore this phenomenon using age distribution data to see if we can reproduce a difference in average age at death purely from the changing rates of left-handedness over time, refuting the claim of early death for left-handers. This notebook uses pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyze the
probability of being a certain age at death given that you are reported as
lefthanded or right-handed.
